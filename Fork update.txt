Use the following commands to add the 'upsteam' (original project location) as a remote branch so that you can get their updates into your branch. 

git remote add --track master upstream git://github.com/upstreamname/projectname.git

This will add the original project as a remote named 'upstream'. To get the code, type:
git fetch upstream

Then, to merge it into your own project, type:
git merge upstream/master

Tada! Now you'll have an up-to-date version of the upstream code in your current branch.
